Scheme is a high level, functional programming language and one of
the most popular dialects of Lisp. While not currently in widespread
use, it's a foundational language that many programming techniques,
such as lambda functions and filter, were first introduced in. Learning
scheme is a good way to deepen  your understanding of these concepts,
as well as a good introduction to functional programming if you're a
beginner to programming, or have only done object orientated programming
before.

To get started, some easy ways to test and run basic scheme programs are:
an online scheme interpreter, Dr.Racket if you want a GUI, or if you prefer
using the command line CHICKEN Scheme or guile.
