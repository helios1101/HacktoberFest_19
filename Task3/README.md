### 0. After forking, cloning 
```$ cd Task3 ```

### 1. Choose your favourite language (if unavailable, make a new folder with that language ), then
```$ cd yourSelectedFolder ```

### 2. Now, [for cpp file]
```$ touch program.cpp```

 Use your favourite editor, (here I'm using Vim) 

```$ vim program.cpp ```

E.g.
Q. Hello World
Sol. Write the program with proper solution and comments and variables
```
